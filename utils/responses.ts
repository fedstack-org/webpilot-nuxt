export const toolUseInstructionsReminder = `# Reminder: Instructions for Tool Use

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>

For example:

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have completed the task...
</result>
</attempt_completion>

Always adhere to this format for all tool uses to ensure proper parsing and execution.`

  `[ERROR] You did not use a tool in your previous response! Please retry with a tool use.

# Next Steps

If you have completed the user's task, use the attempt_completion tool. 
If you require additional information from the user, use the ask_followup_question tool. 
Otherwise, if you have not completed the task and do not need additional information, then proceed with the next step of the task.
